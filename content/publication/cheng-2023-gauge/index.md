abstract: "The recently developed variational discrete action theory (VDAT) provides a systematic variational approach to the ground state of the quantum many-body problem, where the quality of the solution is controlled by an integer N , and increasing N monotonically approaches the exact solution. VDAT can be exactly evaluated in the d =∞ multiorbital Hubbard model using the self-consistent canonical discrete action theory (SCDA), which requires a self-consistency condition for the integer time Green’s functions. Previous work demonstrates that N = 3 accurately captures multiorbital Mott/Hund physics at a cost similar to the Gutzwiller approximation. Here we employ a gauge constraint to automatically satisfy the self-consistency condition of the SCDA at N = 3, yielding an even more efﬁcient algorithm with enhanced numerical stability. We derive closed form expressions of the gauge constrained algorithm for the multiorbital Hubbard model with general density-density interactions, allowing VDAT at N = 3 to be straightforwardly applied to the seven-orbital Hubbard model. The developments in this work will greatly facilitate the application of VDAT at N = 3 to strongly correlated electron materials."
