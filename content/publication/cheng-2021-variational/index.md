abstract: "Here we propose the variational discrete action theory (VDAT) to study the ground state properties of quantum many-body Hamiltonians. VDAT is a variational theory based on the sequential product density matrix (SPD) ansatz, characterized by an integer N , which monotonically approaches the exact solution with increasing N . To evaluate the SPD, we introduce a discrete action and a corresponding integer time Green’s function. We use VDAT to exactly evaluate the SPD in two canonical models of interacting electrons: the Anderson impurity model and the d ¼ ∞ Hubbard model. For the latter, we evaluate N ¼ 2–4, where N ¼ 2 recovers the Gutzwiller approximation (GA), and we show that N ¼ 3, which exactly evaluates the Gutzwiller-Baeriswyl wave function, provides a truly minimal yet precise description of Mott physics with a cost similar to that of the GA. VDAT is a flexible theory for studying quantum Hamiltonians, competing both with state-of-the-art methods and simple, efficient approaches all within a single framework."
