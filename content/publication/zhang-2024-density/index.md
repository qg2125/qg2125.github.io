abstract: "Mean-field theories have proven to be efficient tools for exploring various phases of mat-ter, complementing alternative methods that are more precise but also more computa-tionally demanding. Conventional mean-field theories often fall short in capturing quan-tum fluctuations, which restricts their applicability to systems characterized by strong quantum fluctuations. In this article, we propose a novel mean-field theory, density-matrix mean-field theory (DMMFT). DMMFT constructs effective Hamiltonians, incor-porating quantum environments shaped by entanglements quantified by the reduced density matrices. Therefore, it offers a systematic and unbiased approach to account for effects of fluctuations and entanglements in quantum ordered phases. As demonstrative examples, we show that DMMFT can not only quantitatively evaluate the renormalization of order parameters induced by quantum fluctuations but can even detect the topolog-ical order of quantum phases. Additionally, we discuss the extensions of DMMFT for systems at finite temperatures and those with disorders. Our work provides a novel and efficient approach to explore phases exhibiting unconventional quantum orders, which can be particularly beneficial for investigating frustrated spin systems in high spatial dimensions."
